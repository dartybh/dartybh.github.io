# Hey There!

Thanks for stopping by. You won't find much going on here at the moment but if you're interested in chatting about any of the following topics, hit me up over on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dartybh/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dartybh). I tend to oscillate between the two, so don't
be shy about saying hi on both! If we haven't talked before though, I'll probably decline a LinkedIn connection request, but do send through a message as I'm always up for a chat.
Unless you're trying to cold contact sell me something, then I'm going to remember your company for all the wrong reasons.


## Let's chat about
* Cyber Security
* OSINT
* Dyslexia (including as a strength/competitive advantage)
* Digital Transformation
* A11Y
* Digital Government
